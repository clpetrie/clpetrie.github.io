            As human beings we have build up an intuition for how things should work in this world. Science has shown that our intuition can sometimes be wrong, but there are some things that we assume must be true. One of those things is that the laws of physics (or the laws of nature if you like) are such that they are the same for two people who are not moving relative to each other. The fancy name that we give this property is <span style="font-weight:bold">Lorentz invariance</span>.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are a few different definitions that can be used to describe Lorentz invariance. I'll list some of them here.
